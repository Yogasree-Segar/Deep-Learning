MLP model:
the data set used for this is UCI repository dataset.
the data is split into train and test and later the network is trained and hypertuned for better accuracy.

CNN model:
the data used here is from PhysioNet dataset.
some images were taken and segregated as ictal and preictal images in two folders class1 and class2 respectively
the drive link is given in the mail.
along with the input folder there should be one empty output folder created where the train, test and validation images are split and stored.
these images are used in training.

CNN + LSTM model
the UCI dataset is used here. the data is loaded and later converted to 3d for cnn and lstm models. the function save_3d converts to 3dim.
later the original dataset is split to test and train to test the accuracy of the model.
